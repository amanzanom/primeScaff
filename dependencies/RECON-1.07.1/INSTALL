The RECON package includes three parts -- the C source code in the src
directory, the Perl scripts in the scripts directory, and a Demos
directory containing examplory data.

To install the package, run "make" and then "make install" in the src
directory.  You may have to modify the Makefile in the src directory
to choose the proper C compliler (cc or gcc).

Before you can use the package, you need one more modification in the
script "recon.pl" in the scripts directory -- on the third line, add
the path to the binaries (the bin directory here) between the double
quotes.

Now the package is up for running.  See 00README on how to use the
package.
