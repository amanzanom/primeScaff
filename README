primeScaff v1.6.1
===============

Platform-independent automated primer design around gaps in genomic scaffolds

CHANGES
-------
-> primeScaff v1.6.1 <-
1. Made available packages specific for Linux (i686 and x86_64) ans OSX (i386 and x86_64) to extremely
   simplify installation (Making is super easy!, just download, extract and presto!)
3. Removed the precompiled primersearch. Too many problems trying to link the new files of the EMBOSS
   (primersearch is linked to where one compiles it, as many of the dependencies from this) so now
   each user has to download their own EMBOSS (Instructions below).
2. Added option --scfEnds to report combinations of primers to bridge between scaffolds.
3. Added license details for each 3rd party software included.
4. Created a nice icon.

-> primeScaff v1.6 <-
1. Changed the way the options are assigned to variables to make the code shorter and more understandable
   in both scripts.
2. primeScaff is now distributed with binaries for Linux 32 and 64 bits and some MacOSX 32 and 64 bits
   executables so its now way easier to get it up and running.
3. Changed some lines of code so now it used only one folder for the binaries (the bin/ folder) and
   added a primer3Config/ folder containing the necessary files for primer3 to load the
   thermodynamic parameters and removed the option --thParamPath.
4. Changed the thermodynamics parameters options so that now it is compliant with the latest version
   of primer3 (v2.3.5), released January 3, 2013. So if you're using the most up-to-date version of primer3,
   use this new version of the software.
5. Changed the binaries path variables in both scripts to the new bin folder


-> primeScaff v1.5 <-
1. Made huge changes in the script algorithm itself (mainly passing many parts to subroutines).
2. Made RECON search iterative to improve repetitive element detection and greatly avoid repetitive
   primer design.
3. Greatly improved the speed of the primer search by cutting down the query sequence to one that
   contains the interest and useful one (gap-maxAmp to gap+maxAmp).
4. Added a minGap option to control the minimum size of the gap (in N characters).
5. Added some more notes to the documentation, ESPECIALLY read the note on paths.
6. primeScaff now produces only gff files with embedded sequences.
7. Although primeScaff still outputs a gff2 file compatible with Artemis <v14, it now makes an
   Artemis-compatible gff3.


INSTALL
-------
-> Use the precompiled binaries included in the download <-

DOWNLOAD, EXTRACT (tar -zxvf primescaff-v**_**_***.tar.gz), AND USE!!!

***IF YOU WANT TO USE THE PRIMERCHECK SCRIPT YOU WILL HAVE TO DOWNLOAD YOUR OWN EMBOSS COPY AND COMPILE (SEE BELOW)***

Included in the download you will find a folder named bin/ in which all the precompiled binaries for
Linux and MacOSX 32 and 64 bits are included (in subfolders). to know which type of system you have
you can type in the terminal 'uname -a' and you will most probably see i686 (or if your computer is
really really old you will see i386, i486 or i586) (32-bit) or x86_64 (64-bit). If you have a 
different architecture machine (which should be rare..) you will have to compile your own binaries
(see below).

Inside the bin folder you will subfolders containing the following executable for your architecture:

	-> RECON-v1.07.1
	
	   edgeredef
	   eledef
	   eleredef
	   famdef
	   imagespread
	   
	-> formatdb and megablast
	
	   formatdb
	   megablast
	
	-> primer3
	
	   long_seq_tm_test
	   ntdpal
	   ntthal
	   oligotm
	   primer3_core
	
**** NOTE ON EMBOSS INSTALL ****
LINUX:
	go to the bin folder in your brand new primeScaff dir
	$ cd pathTo/primeScaff-vX.X.X/bin;
	
	Download the latest emboss tools package through the terminal
	$ wget ftp://emboss.open-bio.org/pub/EMBOSS/emboss-latest.tar.gz;
	or in MAC that has no wget
	Download from safari,Firefox,chrome,etc.. ftp://emboss.open-bio.org/pub/EMBOSS/emboss-latest.tar.gz and move the downloaded compressed file to
	pathTo/primeScaff-vX.X.X/bin
	
	Extract the downloaded file
	$ tar -zxvf emboss-latest.tar.gz
	
	Rename the folder into 'EMBOSS'
	$ mv EMBOSS-X.X.X EMBOSS;
	
	Go to the EMBOSS folder and compile emboss
	$ cd EMBOSS;
	$./configure; make;
	
	This should take some minutes and give no errors.
	
	PRESTO! After this, you should have a working primersearch to use with primerCheck script.
	
MAC:
	**** First be sure you have Xcode (and command line tools) installed, if not go to https://developer.apple.com/xcode/, donwload and install****
	You will need to register for an Apple Developer Connection account.
	
		Download Xcode from the app store
		then go to Xcode menu > Preferences > Downloads > choose "Command line tools" > Click "Install" button
		Thats it.
	
	The rest of the steps would be the same as for Linux
	
### NOTE ON PREBUILT BINARIES ###

If you want to test weather the binaries work or not you should try to execute them as './program',
you should see some kind of message. If not that means you will have to build your own binaries
(see the 'Compile yourself the binaries' section on this document).

*********PPC COMPUTERS WILL HAVE TO BUILD THEIR OWN BINARIES************.

#################################

-> Compile yourself the binaries <-

primeScaff and the primerCheck wrapper script are implemented in Perl, requiring the
following core modules which should not require further installation if you already
have Perl installed in your system.

	Getopt::Long;
	Pod::Usage;
	File::Copy;
	
primeScaff depends on the program RECON v1.07.1 which you should have got in the file primeScaff-v1.6.tar.gz
inside the dependencies folder. To be able to run RECON properly one must have both formatdb and megablast
either locally or globally. The script primerCheck depends on primersearch from the EMBOSS package.
Except for RECON, this programs will be usually present in most machines dedicated to bio-informatics.

	Linux and MacOSX

	-> RECON-v1.07.1
	   
	   Open a terminal and go to the RECON-1.07.1/src directory. Type make, and copy the
	   binary files created to the RECON-1.07.1/bin directory.
	   
	   cd dependencies/RECON-1.07.1/src
	   make
	   cp edgeredef pathTo/primeScaff/bin/recon
	   cp eledef pathTo/primeScaff/bin/recon
	   cp eleredef pathTo/primeScaff/bin/recon
	   cp famdef pathTo/primeScaff/bin/recon
	   cp imagespread pathTo/primeScaff/bin/recon
	
	-> formatdb and megablast
	
	   On Ubuntu or other Linux debian systems you can install it simply using apt-get install <name_of_the_package>,
	   on Ubuntu 12.04 and 10.04 the package is called blast2. If not, blast pre-compiled executables can be
	   found here ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/executables/release/LATEST/, simply decompress the package
	   and the executables must be in the 'bin/' subfolder. then move the formatdb and megablast binaries to
	   the bin/ subfolder of primeScaff.
	   
	   cd blast-X.X.XX/bin;
	   cp formatdb pathTo/primeScaff/bin/blast
	   cp megablast pathTo/primeScaff/bin/blast
	   
	   Alternatively download the file 'ncbi-blast-2.2.28+-src.tar.gz' and follow the compilation instructions
	   and then copy the formatdb and megablast binaries to 'pathTo/primeScaff/bin' folder.
	
	-> primer3
	
	   On Ubuntu or other Linux debian systems you can install it simply using apt-get install <name_of_the_package>,
	   on Ubuntu 12.04 and 10.04 the package is called primer3. If not, source code can be downloaded from
	   here http://sourceforge.net/projects/primer3/, simply decompress the package, move to the 'src/' folder
	   'cd src', and then type 'make all' and the executables must be in the same 'src/' folder.
	   
	   tar -zxvf primer3-x.x.x.tar.gz
	   cd primer3-x.x.x/src
	   make all
	   cp long_seq_tm_test pathTo/primeScaff/bin/prmier3
	   cp ntdpal pathTo/primeScaff/bin/prmier3
	   cp ntthal pathTo/primeScaff/bin/prmier3
	   cp oligotm pathTo/primeScaff/bin/prmier3
	   cp primer3_core pathTo/primeScaff/bin/prmier3
	   
	-> primersearch
	   
	   On Ubuntu or other Linux debian systems you can install it simply using apt-get install <name_of_the_package>,
	   on Ubuntu 12.04 and 10.04 the package is called emboss. If not, source code can be downloaded from
	   here ftp://emboss.open-bio.org/pub/EMBOSS/. Download the file emboss-latest.tar.gz and then simply
	   decompress the package and then go to the decompressed directory and type './configure' and then 'make'.
	   This will build executables to your system in the emboss/ subdirectory.
	   
	   tar -zxvf emboss-latest.tar.gz
	   mv EMBOSS-x.x.x EMBOSS
	   cd EMBOSS
	   make

**************READ THE NOTE ON PATHS***************************s


RUNNING primeScaff AND primerCheck
----------------------------------

Typing perl primeScaff -man or primerCheck -man will give you all the options available and the syntax to run the
scripts. Examples of "standard" runs of primeScaff can be found below:

perl primeScaff.pl -i scaffolds.fasta --ampSize '100-2000' -p outFile -d outDir --best --clean

perl primerCheck.pl -i 'outDir/SCt_gapClose.primer.fasta' -s 'outDir/outFile.masked.fasta' -p outFile

******NOTES********
	1. Remember to use simple names for the fasta Headers, trying to avoid any non-alpha-numeric character like in the 
	   example files
	   >Rinsect_LSR1_Scaffold1
	   Otherwise it can cause RECON to crash
	2. Since version 14, Artemis uses GFF3 files. Other older versions should work with GFF2 files. GFF2 files of
	   primeScaff were tested with v13.xx. For older versions of Artemis (meaning <14, GFF2 files are still
	   generated)
****	3. VERY IMPORTANT: REMEMBER TO KEEP PATHS SIMPLE AND FREE OF THINGS LIKE WHITE-SPACES OR TO WRITE THEM
	   WITH THE PROBLEMATIC CHARACTERS PROPERLY ESCAPED. TRY TO AVOID RELATIVE PATHS. ALWAYS TRY TO USE
	   ABSOLUTE PATHS
	   

TIPS
----

	1. To find out where the binary files are located if they were added to the PATH environment variable simply
	   type 'which program'  

	2. For changing headers of FASTA files downloaded from the NCBIs genome database you can use:
	   
	   sed 's/^>\S\+ Strain Name/>Short_version_strain_name/' inFile.fasta | sed 's/ genomic scaffold//' | sed 's/\, .\+$//' | sed 's/ /_/g'  > temp; mv temp inFile.fasta


CITING
------

A primeScaff publication is intended and hopefully we manage to publish it soon. In the meanwhile, refer to
the sourceforge web page of primeScaff
